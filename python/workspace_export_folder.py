"""One stable local handoff folder per project, shared by every export format."""
from pathlib import Path

GUIDE = '''# Local project exports

Point Wheeler, MATLAB, or another analysis service at this folder once.
Each UUID subfolder is one export; keep its recipe and identities with its data.

- recordings.sqlite: frozen metadata for Wheeler and other SQL clients.
- epictree-bundle.zip: frozen MATLAB bundle; the matlab/ folder holds its local working files.
- recordings.json and recipe.json: exact source identities and export membership.
- annotation-return.json: tag-return format and exact allowed targets for SQLite exports.

Return new tags to <export UUID>/annotations/incoming/ as complete JSON messages.
The open project app picks these up automatically. Read annotation-return.json for examples.

Save updated MATLAB selection masks as <export UUID>/selection.ugm or update
<export UUID>/matlab/selection.ugm in place. Refresh metadata in the app discovers
them and offers Apply updated mask. It validates the export and exact epoch UUIDs.
Do not edit recordings.sqlite or epictree-bundle.zip; their checksums preserve the export.

Use completed exports shown in the app's Export log. A failure.json marks an
unsuccessful export attempt. This folder belongs to one project; UUIDs must not
be replaced with filenames, cell labels, or row numbers.
