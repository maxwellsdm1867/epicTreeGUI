# 🚀 RUN ME FIRST - Fixed Version!

All classes have been renamed to avoid conflicts. No more "brace indexing" errors!

---

## Step 1: Quick Verification (30 seconds)

Run this to verify the rename worked:

```matlab
cd('/Users/maxwellsdm/Documents/GitHub/epicTreeGUI')
run test_quick.m
```

**Expected output:**
```
=== Quick Class Test ===

Test 1: Creating epicGraphicalTree...
   ✓ SUCCESS

Test 2: Creating epicGraphicalTreeNode...
   ✓ SUCCESS

Test 3: Checking for name conflicts...
   Old graphicalTree: ...
   New epicGraphicalTree: .../src/gui/epicGraphicalTree.m
   ✓ epicGraphicalTree found in correct location

=== ALL TESTS PASSED ===
```

## Step 2: Test Full GUI with Epoch Flattening

If Step 1 passed, run the full test:

```matlab
run test_renamed.m
```

**Expected behavior:**
- GUI launches without errors
- Tree displays with hierarchy
- Expand nodes to see individual epochs (pink backgrounds)
- Click epoch → single trace
- Click protocol → aggregated traces
- **NO "brace indexing" error when clicking!**

---

## What Was Fixed

✅ **Renamed all classes to avoid conflicts:**
- `graphicalTree` → `epicGraphicalTree`
- `graphicalTreeNode` → `epicGraphicalTreeNode`
- `graphicalTreeNodeWidget` → `epicGraphicalTreeNodeWidget`

✅ **Fixed all constructors** to match new class names

✅ **Updated epicTreeGUI.m** to use renamed classes

✅ **Implemented epoch flattening** at leaf level (pink backgrounds)

---

## Files Created/Updated

### Core Classes (Renamed)
- `src/gui/epicGraphicalTree.m` ✅
- `src/gui/epicGraphicalTreeNode.m` ✅
- `src/gui/epicGraphicalTreeNodeWidget.m` ✅

### Main GUI
- `epicTreeGUI.m` - Updated to use epic* classes ✅

### Test Scripts
- `test_quick.m` - Quick verification test ⭐ **Run this first!**
- `test_renamed.m` - Full GUI test with epoch flattening
- `verify_rename.m` - Comprehensive verification

### Documentation
- `RENAMING_SOLUTION.md` - Technical details
- `RUN_ME_FIRST.md` - This file!

---

## Troubleshooting

### If test_quick.m fails:

1. **Check you're in the right directory:**
   ```matlab
   pwd  % Should be .../epicTreeGUI
   ```

2. **Check paths:**
   ```matlab
   which epicGraphicalTree
   % Should show: .../src/gui/epicGraphicalTree.m
   ```

3. **Clear and try again:**
   ```matlab
   clear all
   close all
   run test_quick.m
   ```

### If test_renamed.m shows errors:

Run the verification:
```matlab
run verify_rename.m
```

This will check:
- All files exist
- Class definitions are correct
- Constructors are correct
- No old class name references

---

## What Works Now

✅ **No path management needed** - The `epic` prefix avoids all conflicts
✅ **Individual epochs displayed** - Pink backgrounds at leaf level
✅ **Dual click behavior** - Epoch vs node shows different data
✅ **Selection syncing** - Checkboxes work on both types
✅ **Protocol name abbreviation** - Short names instead of full Java packages
✅ **Pre-built trees** - Build tree in code before GUI

---

## Next: Test It!

```matlab
cd('/Users/maxwellsdm/Documents/GitHub/epicTreeGUI')
run test_quick.m      % Verify classes work (30 sec)
run test_renamed.m    % Full GUI test (launches GUI)
```

---

## If Everything Works

The rename solution is complete! 🎉

Next step (future): Embed the tree visualization code directly into `epicTreeGUI.m` as nested classes to make it completely self-contained.

See `RENAMING_SOLUTION.md` for details on embedding.
