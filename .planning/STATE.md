# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-06)

**Core value:** Researchers should be able to discover, install, understand, and use epicTreeGUI without prior knowledge of the Rieke Lab system or legacy epoch tree tools.
**Current focus:** Phase 0 - Testing & Validation

## Current Position

Phase: 0 of 4 (Testing & Validation)
Plan: 1 of TBD in current phase
Status: In progress
Last activity: 2026-02-07 - Completed 00-01-PLAN.md (test framework infrastructure)

Progress: [█░░░░░░░░░] ~10% (estimated, Phase 0 scope TBD)

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 1
- Average duration: 2 min
- Total execution time: 0.03 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 0 (Testing) | 1 | 2min | 2min |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 00-01 (2min)
- Trend: Just started

*Updated after each plan completion*

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Public GitHub release: Make tool available to broader neuroscience community
- Documentation over features: 95% functional, need usability not features
- Defer v1.1 enhancements: Ship complete docs faster than adding features
- Remove old_epochtree/: Legacy reference code not needed for users

**From 00-01:**
- Use absolute paths for test data (simpler than relative path resolution)
- Multi-level tree in tests (enables deeper navigation validation)
- Reset selection state before each test (prevents test interference)
